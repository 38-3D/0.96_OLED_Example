## Arduino OLED Display Examples

Welcome to the Arduino OLED Display Examples repository! This project provides simple and easy-to-understand examples to help you get started with using a 0.96" OLED screen in your Arduino projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these examples will demonstrate how to display text and graphics on the OLED screen.

## üöÄ Examples

In the `examples` folder, you will find the following Arduino projects:

1. **Hello World Example**:  
   A basic example showing how to display "Hello, World!" on a 0.96" OLED screen. Perfect for getting started with the OLED and understanding how to set up your display.

2. **Rotating Cube Example**:  
   A more advanced example that shows how to create a rotating 3D cube on the OLED screen using basic 3D projection techniques. A great project to explore the power of the OLED screen and the Adafruit GFX library.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
- **0.96" OLED Display** (I2C or SPI)
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Adafruit GFX Library**
- **Adafruit SSD1306 Library**

Make sure to install the necessary libraries via the Arduino Library Manager before running the examples.
